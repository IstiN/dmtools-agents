# PR Review Input Context — reading order (base contract, gh-1406)

Reviewer-agnostic: EVERY reviewer leg reads the same PR context. Read files
that exist in `input/` locally — do NOT re-fetch via dmtools.

    subgraph PR_CONTEXT["⚠️ PR-specific files (read first)"]
        P1["1️⃣ instruction.md (repo root) — project stack, conventions"]
        P2["2️⃣ input/TICKET/pr_info.md — PR title, author, branch, description"]
        P3["3️⃣ input/TICKET/pr_diff.txt — the diff to review"]
        P4["4️⃣ input/TICKET/pr_files.txt — list of changed files"]
        P5["5️⃣ input/TICKET/ci_failures.md — CI failures = BLOCKING (last 500 lines)"]
        P5_FULL["5️⃣ input/TICKET/ci_failures_full.log — full CI logs"]
        P6["6️⃣ input/TICKET/pr_discussions.md + pr_discussions_raw.json — existing comments"]
        P7["7️⃣ input/TICKET/pr_findings.md — previously raised findings (when present)"]
        P8["8️⃣ input/TICKET/review_policy.md — the resolved reviewPolicy: severity table, density cap, downgrade protocol"]
        P9["9️⃣ input/TICKET/pr_new_hunks.txt — the hunks added since the last reviewed head (re-review rounds; when present)"]
        P1 --> P2 --> P3 --> P4 --> P5 --> P5_FULL --> P6 --> P7 --> P8 --> P9
    end

    subgraph TICKET_CONTEXT["Ticket context (for understanding PR purpose)"]

Read PR files to understand WHAT changed. Read ticket files to understand WHY
it changed and verify against requirements.
